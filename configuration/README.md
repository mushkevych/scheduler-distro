WARNING: content of this folder will become invisible as soon as the Docker Engine mounts a volume.  
It is expected that mounted volume will bring settings_XXX.py, flow_XXX.py and context_XXX.py configurations.  
@see docker-compose.yml for details. 

This folder is kept for visual reference and development-time use.

NOTE: settings_dev.py is moved in this folder during container start-up by the scripts/endpoint.sh
